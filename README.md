### Problem Sheet Tasks
Task 01 contains helloworld.py which reads 'Hello World!'


Task 02 is bank.py
- _First attempt at problem_ - 
Tried to solve after lecture 02 - should research if there is a function to convert the total in cent into euro.
- _Updated_
Used the W3 tutorials to help with final part.


Task 03 is accounts.py
- Have not tried the extra part yet.

Task 04 is collatz.py
- Working on loops -> if, else, while statements.
- Needed help from StackOverflow here. Understood some of the loops but struggled with continuation.
- Used some code that I found easiest to understand, and aim to return to this problem to experiment.

Task 05 is weekday.py
- A program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday
- Encouraged to search the web.
- Some sources [1]

Task 06 is sqrt.py
- A program that uses a function to output an approximate square root of a number.
- Suggested reading/research was around the Newton method so as not to use built in functions.
- Watched a simple YouTube clip around the formula [2]
- Also looked at some code on the internet [3] that followed a similar idea.
- Found some other examples on Youtube and Stackoverflow but I found them more complicated to understand as they dealt with estimates and intercepts. [4]
- Using the reading I was able to write some code that I think accomplishes the task.
- Had to trust the 'black box' reference with regards the function as it seemed to be accomplishing the task.
