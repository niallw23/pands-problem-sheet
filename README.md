### Problem Sheet Tasks
Task 01 contains helloworld.py which reads 'Hello World!'


Task 02 is bank.py
- _First attempt at problem_ - 
Tried to solve after lecture 02 - should research if there is a function to convert the total in cent into euro.
- _Updated_
Used the W3 tutorials to help with final part.


Task 03 is accounts.py
- Have not tried the extra part yet.

Task 04 is collatz.py
- Working on loops -> if, else, while statements.
- Needed help from StackOverflow here. Understood some of the loops but struggled with continuation.
- Used some code that I found easiest to understand, and aim to return to this problem to experiment.

Task 05 is weekday.py
- A program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday
- Encouraged to search the web.
- Some sources [1]

Task 06 is sqrt.py
- A program that uses a function to output an approximate square root of a number.
- Suggested reading/research was around the Newton method so as not to use built in functions.
- Watched a simple YouTube clip around the formula [2]
- Also looked at some code on the internet [3] that followed a similar idea.
- Found some other examples on Youtube and Stackoverflow but I found them more complicated to understand as they dealt with estimates and intercepts. [4]
- Using the reading I was able to write some code that I think accomplishes the task.
- Had to trust the 'black box' reference with regards the function as it seemed to be accomplishing the task.

The folder Week 07 has the weekly task for Week 7.
The folder was created to hold the .txt file as well as the .py file.

- This task required research around using command line arguments.
- I watched a YouTube clip to get some understanding. [5]
- It pointed me to the python library sys.
- I looked at some sample code [6]
- I then tried to combine the video, the code and what was being asked in the weekly task.
- This helped me with the counting the letters. [7]
