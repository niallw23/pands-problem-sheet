# Week 4 Task
# Program that that asks the user to input any positive integer
# and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

# At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, 
# if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

# Have the program end if the current value is one.

posint = int(input ('Please enter a positive integer: '))
